# tic-tac-toe
Tic-tac-toe is a popular game. Almost everyone knows it. But do you know that a machine can play this game? There are some algorithms to play the game, but we want to build a bot that can automatically play the game.

We use machine learning. The computer uses a script called neataptic.js. It is really powerful and easy to use.

It might sound funny that a machine can play a game without knowing the rules. Try this out. Because we wanted to save your time, we only train it for 300 generations. You can modify it in brain.js.

The training process is the bot fighting to a default algorithm which is very foolish. After some time, it can beat the default algorithm easily.

But sometimes, the bot is disqualified. It is a bug and I don't know what to do about it. Pull requests are always welcome.
